Also, Broom (1909 in Rogers & Du Toit) and later Oelofsen & Araujo (1987, S. Afr. J.

Furthermore, Anderson & Reisz (2003) do not explicitly assign the remainder of ""species x"" to Bolterpeton.

The bed from which the fossils come is a deep red shale, exposed on a series of hills over an area about an eighth of a mile on each side. This bed is capped in many places by a thin, dense siltstone. Overlying the siltstone is an orange-red shale that carries gypsum biscuits. Underlying the producing layer, which averages about four feet in thickness, is a brownish-red shale that is devoid\r\nof fossils. The most distinctive feature of the bone-bearing shale, outside of the fact that it has fossils, is the occurrence of two types of vertically oriented ovoid structures. One type consists of mottled red and green, hard nodules that range from one to four inches in maximum diameter and up to eighteen inches in length. They are rich in vertebrate remains. They appear to have formed around the bones after deposition, presumably as a result of the reducing action of organic materials. Their vertical orientation is somewhat\r\npuzzling. The contained vertebrate remains are usually oriented with their long axes vertical, and it seems quite certain that this position was attained after the formation of the nodules. Specimens of vertebrates free in the shale rather than in nodules are orientated with their long axes horizontal and have been subjected to considerable distortion and breakage. The most reasonable suggestion seems to be that the vertical orientation of the nodules was developed during compaction of the shales, which has been extensive, with the long axes shifting to become normal to the compacting forces.\r\nThe other vertical structures [...] have been termed pipes and have given the name to the site. They pass from the base to the top of the fossiliferous bed and, at the top, are continuous with the siltstone layer that caps the bed. Their composition is similar to the capping siltstone. The pipes are oval in cross section with maximum diameters from about four to twelve inches. Orientation of the long diameters is random, even in the 'clumps' in which the pipes tend to occur. These structures do not contain vertebrates, although specimens are found 'plastered' to their sides and occasionally penetrating the pipe for a short distance.\r\nThe origin of the pipes is by no means certain. It is thought that they were formed in open holes by the introduction of the sediment that formed the siltstone layer. Superficially, they resemble lungfish burrows of the Arroyo and Vale (Romer and Olson, 1954), but the shape, size, composition, weathering, and fossil content differ. The most probable explanation is that these openings were formed by the root-like shafts of some type of plant, possibly some\r\nEquisetales, that rotted to leave openings that were later filled by sediment. There is no question that the red shales surrounding the pipes were deposited in a shallow pond, and such a pond might well have provided suitable habitat for the type of vegetation envisaged.""

The bed from which the fossils come is a deep red shale, exposed on a series of hills over an area about an eighth of a mile on each side. This bed is capped in many places by a thin, dense siltstone. Overlying the siltstone is an orange-red shale that carries gypsum biscuits. Underlying the producing layer, which averages about four feet in thickness, is a brownish-red shale that is devoid\r\nof fossils. The most distinctive feature of the bone-bearing shale, outside of the fact that it has fossils, is the occurrence of two types of vertically oriented ovoid structures. One type consists of mottled red and green, hard nodules that range from one to four inches in maximum diameter and up to eighteen inches in length. They are rich in vertebrate remains. They appear to have formed around the bones after deposition, presumably as a result of the reducing action of organic materials. Their vertical orientation is somewhat\r\npuzzling. The contained vertebrate remains are usually oriented with their long axes vertical, and it seems quite certain that this position was attained after the formation of the nodules. Specimens of vertebrates free in the shale rather than in nodules are orientated with their long axes horizontal and have been subjected to considerable distortion and breakage. The most reasonable suggestion seems to be that the vertical orientation of the nodules was developed during compaction of the shales, which has been extensive, with the long axes shifting to become normal to the compacting forces.\r\nThe other vertical structures [...] have been termed pipes and have given the name to the site. They pass from the base to the top of the fossiliferous bed and, at the top, are continuous with the siltstone layer that caps the bed. Their composition is similar to the capping siltstone. The pipes are oval in cross section with maximum diameters from about four to twelve inches. Orientation of the long diameters is random, even in the 'clumps' in which the pipes tend to occur. These structures do not contain vertebrates, although specimens are found 'plastered' to their sides and occasionally penetrating the pipe for a short distance.\r\nThe origin of the pipes is by no means certain. It is thought that they were formed in open holes by the introduction of the sediment that formed the siltstone layer. Superficially, they resemble lungfish burrows of the Arroyo and Vale (Romer and Olson, 1954), but the shape, size, composition, weathering, and fossil content differ. The most probable explanation is that these openings were formed by the root-like shafts of some type of plant, possibly some\r\nEquisetales, that rotted to leave openings that were later filled by sediment. There is no question that the red shales surrounding the pipes were deposited in a shallow pond, and such a pond might well have provided suitable habitat for the type of vegetation envisaged.""

Since UCMP 62480 is a braincase according to Lund (1978) and UCMP 62580 is a braincase as well (McGinnis, 1967; Lund, 1978) and since there is only one aistopod braincase present in the Fort Sill material (Anderson, 2002) the type of S. permianum is very likely to be UCMP 62580.\r\nAnderson & Reisz (2003) do not explicitly say when the type of Bolterpeton carrolli was collected but it is improbable that this specimen was known to Bolt in 1980.

Furthermore, Anderson & Reisz (2003) do not explicitly assign the remainder of ""species x"" to Bolterpeton. Nevertheless they say that these specimens are ""closely related"" to Bolterpeton, but ""because of the size difference between Bolterpeton and Species X, it cannot be said whether Species X is a different species or an ontogenetic variant.""

The latter is listed as referred specimen of S. permianum in Lund (1978 p. 66). Anderson (2002, J. Paleont. 76(6) p. 1031) lists both UCMP 62480 and 62580 as type of S. permianum. Since UCMP 62480 is a braincase according to Lund (1978) and UCMP 62580 is a braincase as well (McGinnis, 1967; Lund, 1978) and since there is only one aistopod braincase present in the Fort Sill material (Anderson, 2002) the type of S. permianum is very likely to be UCMP 62580.\r\nAnderson & Reisz (2003) do not explicitly say when the type of Bolterpeton carrolli was collected but it is improbable that this specimen was known to Bolt in 1980.

Furthermore, Anderson & Reisz (2003) do not explicitly assign the remainder of ""species x"" to Bolterpeton. Nevertheless they say that these specimens are ""closely related"" to Bolterpeton, but ""because of the size difference between Bolterpeton and Species X, it cannot be said whether Species X is a different species or an ontogenetic variant.""

The bed from which the fossils come is a deep red shale, exposed on a series of hills over an area about an eighth of a mile on each side. This bed is capped in many places by a thin, dense siltstone. Overlying the siltstone is an orange-red shale that carries gypsum biscuits. Underlying the producing layer, which averages about four feet in thickness, is a brownish-red shale that is devoid\r\nof fossils. The most distinctive feature of the bone-bearing shale, outside of the fact that it has fossils, is the occurrence of two types of vertically oriented ovoid structures. One type consists of mottled red and green, hard nodules that range from one to four inches in maximum diameter and up to eighteen inches in length. They are rich in vertebrate remains. They appear to have formed around the bones after deposition, presumably as a result of the reducing action of organic materials. Their vertical orientation is somewhat\r\npuzzling. The contained vertebrate remains are usually oriented with their long axes vertical, and it seems quite certain that this position was attained after the formation of the nodules. Specimens of vertebrates free in the shale rather than in nodules are orientated with their long axes horizontal and have been subjected to considerable distortion and breakage. The most reasonable suggestion seems to be that the vertical orientation of the nodules was developed during compaction of the shales, which has been extensive, with the long axes shifting to become normal to the compacting forces.\r\nThe other vertical structures [...] have been termed pipes and have given the name to the site. They pass from the base to the top of the fossiliferous bed and, at the top, are continuous with the siltstone layer that caps the bed. Their composition is similar to the capping siltstone. The pipes are oval in cross section with maximum diameters from about four to twelve inches. Orientation of the long diameters is random, even in the 'clumps' in which the pipes tend to occur. These structures do not contain vertebrates, although specimens are found 'plastered' to their sides and occasionally penetrating the pipe for a short distance.\r\nThe origin of the pipes is by no means certain. It is thought that they were formed in open holes by the introduction of the sediment that formed the siltstone layer. Superficially, they resemble lungfish burrows of the Arroyo and Vale (Romer and Olson, 1954), but the shape, size, composition, weathering, and fossil content differ. The most probable explanation is that these openings were formed by the root-like shafts of some type of plant, possibly some\r\nEquisetales, that rotted to leave openings that were later filled by sediment. There is no question that the red shales surrounding the pipes were deposited in a shallow pond, and such a pond might well have provided suitable habitat for the type of vegetation envisaged.""

This bed is capped in many places by a thin, dense siltstone. Overlying the siltstone is an orange-red shale that carries gypsum biscuits. Underlying the producing layer, which averages about four feet in thickness, is a brownish-red shale that is devoid\r\nof fossils. The most distinctive feature of the bone-bearing shale, outside of the fact that it has fossils, is the occurrence of two types of vertically oriented ovoid structures. One type consists of mottled red and green, hard nodules that range from one to four inches in maximum diameter and up to eighteen inches in length. They are rich in vertebrate remains. They appear to have formed around the bones after deposition, presumably as a result of the reducing action of organic materials. Their vertical orientation is somewhat\r\npuzzling. The contained vertebrate remains are usually oriented with their long axes vertical, and it seems quite certain that this position was attained after the formation of the nodules. Specimens of vertebrates free in the shale rather than in nodules are orientated with their long axes horizontal and have been subjected to considerable distortion and breakage. The most reasonable suggestion seems to be that the vertical orientation of the nodules was developed during compaction of the shales, which has been extensive, with the long axes shifting to become normal to the compacting forces.\r\nThe other vertical structures [...] have been termed pipes and have given the name to the site.

These structures do not contain vertebrates, although specimens are found 'plastered' to their sides and occasionally penetrating the pipe for a short distance.\r\nThe origin of the pipes is by no means certain. It is thought that they were formed in open holes by the introduction of the sediment that formed the siltstone layer. Superficially, they resemble lungfish burrows of the Arroyo and Vale (Romer and Olson, 1954), but the shape, size, composition, weathering, and fossil content differ. The most probable explanation is that these openings were formed by the root-like shafts of some type of plant, possibly some\r\nEquisetales, that rotted to leave openings that were later filled by sediment.

OMNH 71111 and OMNH 71112, although not explicitly mentioned by Bolt (1980), well may belong to the material that was originally assigned to ""species x"". Furthermore, Anderson & Reisz (2003) do not explicitly assign the remainder of ""species x"" to Bolterpeton. Nevertheless they say that these specimens are ""closely related"" to Bolterpeton, but ""because of the size difference between Bolterpeton and Species X, it cannot be said whether Species X is a different species or an ontogenetic variant."" Thus, these specimens are re-identified here as ?

Thus, the present collection is assigned to the Whitehill Fm.\r\nRadiometric ages of the Collinson Fm. (overlying the Whitehill Fm.) vary between 270 and 275 Ma (Turner, 1999, J. Afr. Earth Sci. 28(1); Fildani et al., 2007 J. Sedim. Res. 77), and radiometric ages of the basal beds of the Prince Albert Fm. (underlying the Whitehill Fm.) vary between 293 and 285 Ma (Bangert et al., 1999, J. Afr. Earth Sci. 29(1)), implying an Artinskian age for the Whitehill Fm. (cf. time scales of Gradstein et al. (2004) and Ogg et al. (2008)). Radiometric dating within the Whitehill Fm. of southern Namibia (Werner, 2006, PhD thesis, http://www.opus-bayern.de/uni-wuerzburg/volltexte/2007/2175/pdf/00-Complete_thesis-STD.pdf) corroborates an assigment to the Artinskian.",""" [...] exceedingly soft shale [...] "" (Broom, 1905).","""shale""",,poorly lithified,,Y,,,,,,marine indet.,foreland basin,,macrofossils,,,,,,,,"body,mold/impression",good,autochthonous,time-averaged,,,,,,,,,,taxonomic,survey of museum collection,,,,,C.

Since UCMP 62480 is a braincase according to Lund (1978) and UCMP 62580 is a braincase as well (McGinnis, 1967; Lund, 1978) and since there is only one aistopod braincase present in the Fort Sill material (Anderson, 2002) the type of S. permianum is very likely to be UCMP 62580.\r\nAnderson & Reisz (2003) do not explicitly say when the type of Bolterpeton carrolli was collected but it is improbable that this specimen was known to Bolt in 1980.

Furthermore, Anderson & Reisz (2003) do not explicitly assign the remainder of ""species x"" to Bolterpeton. Nevertheless they say that these specimens are ""closely related"" to Bolterpeton, but ""because of the size difference between Bolterpeton and Species X, it cannot be said whether Species X is a different species or an ontogenetic variant.""

The latter is listed as referred specimen of S. permianum in Lund (1978 p. 66). Anderson (2002, J. Paleont. 76(6) p. 1031) lists both UCMP 62480 and 62580 as type of S. permianum. Since UCMP 62480 is a braincase according to Lund (1978) and UCMP 62580 is a braincase as well (McGinnis, 1967; Lund, 1978) and since there is only one aistopod braincase present in the Fort Sill material (Anderson, 2002) the type of S. permianum is very likely to be UCMP 62580.\r\nAnderson & Reisz (2003) do not explicitly say when the type of Bolterpeton carrolli was collected but it is improbable that this specimen was known to Bolt in 1980. OMNH 71111 and OMNH 71112, although not explicitly mentioned by Bolt (1980), well may belong to the material that was originally assigned to ""species x"". Furthermore, Anderson & Reisz (2003) do not explicitly assign the remainder of ""species x"" to Bolterpeton. Nevertheless they say that these specimens are ""closely related"" to Bolterpeton, but ""because of the size difference between Bolterpeton and Species X, it cannot be said whether Species X is a different species or an ontogenetic variant.""

Since UCMP 62480 is a braincase according to Lund (1978) and UCMP 62580 is a braincase as well (McGinnis, 1967; Lund, 1978) and since there is only one aistopod braincase present in the Fort Sill material (Anderson, 2002) the type of S. permianum is very likely to be UCMP 62580.\r\nAnderson & Reisz (2003) do not explicitly say when the type of Bolterpeton carrolli was collected but it is improbable that this specimen was known to Bolt in 1980.

Furthermore, Anderson & Reisz (2003) do not explicitly assign the remainder of ""species x"" to Bolterpeton. Nevertheless they say that these specimens are ""closely related"" to Bolterpeton, but ""because of the size difference between Bolterpeton and Species X, it cannot be said whether Species X is a different species or an ontogenetic variant.""

Since UCMP 62480 is a braincase according to Lund (1978) and UCMP 62580 is a braincase as well (McGinnis, 1967; Lund, 1978) and since there is only one aistopod braincase present in the Fort Sill material (Anderson, 2002) the type of S. permianum is very likely to be UCMP 62580.\r\nAnderson & Reisz (2003) do not explicitly say when the type of Bolterpeton carrolli was collected but it is improbable that this specimen was known to Bolt in 1980. OMNH 71111 and OMNH 71112, although not explicitly mentioned by Bolt (1980), well may belong to the material that was originally assigned to ""species x"". Furthermore, Anderson & Reisz (2003) do not explicitly assign the remainder of ""species x"" to Bolterpeton. Nevertheless they say that these specimens are ""closely related"" to Bolterpeton, but ""because of the size difference between Bolterpeton and Species X, it cannot be said whether Species X is a different species or an ontogenetic variant."" Thus, these specimens are re-identified here as ?

Coordinates based on Autun",gp_mid,18,1.68,305,FR,,Millery,,,bed,,,,,,,,"""Bituminous beds of the ‘Autunian’ series, Autun basin. There was unfortunately no indication of the geographical or stratigraphical provenance on the label found with MNHN.F.AUT 891 or in the registration catalogue when it was originally numbered R-142. However, the preservation state of the specimen, as well as its embedding matrix, are very similar than those of the holotype of Haptodus baylei (MNHN 1884-26-3A and B), therefore suggesting MNHN.F.AUT 891 was collected from the same Millery Formation. Notwithstanding these uncertainties, MNHN.F.AUT 891 can be relatively well dated, thanks to the abundant macro- and microflora produced by the whole ‘Autunian’ series (Moloy to Millery formations) [e.g., Châteauneuf et al., 1992; Broutin et al., 1999]. A similar Autunian flora have indeed been identified in other Peri-Tethyan basins, notably in the Donets basin [Izart, Briand et al., 1998; Broutin in Izart, Vaslet et al., 1998; Stchegolev in Izart, Vaslet et al., 1998] in which the presence of marine interbedding allowed the stratigraphic correlation of the Autunian with the late Gzhelian (= Orenburgian Russian stage) to Asselian interval on the basis of fusulinids and conodonts [Izart, Briand et al., 1998; Izart, Vaslet et al., 1998]. In the Donets basin, the underlying Stephanian ‘C’ is correlated to the early Gzhelian (= Gzhelian sensu stricto Russian stage), but the Stephanian ‘C’/Autunian boundary remains uncertain as long as the Autunian can be defined by either the First Appearance Datum (FAD) or the acme of meso-xerophytic flora [Izart, Vaslet et al., 1998]. In addition, the absence of younger flora precludes the identification of the upper Autunian boundary in the overlying early Sakmarian strata.""",,not reported,,,,,,,,,,terrestrial indet.,,,macrofossils,none,some,,,,,,body,medium,,snapshot,,,,,,,,,,taxonomic,survey of museum collection,MNHN,,,,,,,,terrestrial,Amniota,actively mobile,Osteichthyes,,Amniota,,,,,,,,,,hydroxyapatite,,,,Vertebrata,Belebey,,,,augustodunensis,n. sp.,677,Gzhelian,-,Gzhelian,"Gzhelian, Asselian","Gzhelian, Asselian",vertebrate,J.

The latter is listed as referred specimen of S. permianum in Lund (1978 p. 66). Anderson (2002, J. Paleont. 76(6) p. 1031) lists both UCMP 62480 and 62580 as type of S. permianum. Since UCMP 62480 is a braincase according to Lund (1978) and UCMP 62580 is a braincase as well (McGinnis, 1967; Lund, 1978) and since there is only one aistopod braincase present in the Fort Sill material (Anderson, 2002) the type of S. permianum is very likely to be UCMP 62580.\r\nAnderson & Reisz (2003) do not explicitly say when the type of Bolterpeton carrolli was collected but it is improbable that this specimen was known to Bolt in 1980. OMNH 71111 and OMNH 71112, although not explicitly mentioned by Bolt (1980), well may belong to the material that was originally assigned to ""species x"". Furthermore, Anderson & Reisz (2003) do not explicitly assign the remainder of ""species x"" to Bolterpeton. Nevertheless they say that these specimens are ""closely related"" to Bolterpeton, but ""because of the size difference between Bolterpeton and Species X, it cannot be said whether Species X is a different species or an ontogenetic variant."" Thus, these specimens are re-identified here as ?

This specimen number, however, does not appear among the specimens of Phlegethontia cf. longissima listed by McGinnis (1967 p. 2) but one of these specimens bears the catalogue number UCMP 62580. The latter is listed as referred specimen of S. permianum in Lund (1978 p. 66). Anderson (2002, J. Paleont. 76(6) p. 1031) lists both UCMP 62480 and 62580 as type of S. permianum. Since UCMP 62480 is a braincase according to Lund (1978) and UCMP 62580 is a braincase as well (McGinnis, 1967; Lund, 1978) and since there is only one aistopod braincase present in the Fort Sill material (Anderson, 2002) the type of S. permianum is very likely to be UCMP 62580.\r\nAnderson & Reisz (2003) do not explicitly say when the type of Bolterpeton carrolli was collected but it is improbable that this specimen was known to Bolt in 1980. OMNH 71111 and OMNH 71112, although not explicitly mentioned by Bolt (1980), well may belong to the material that was originally assigned to ""species x"". Furthermore, Anderson & Reisz (2003) do not explicitly assign the remainder of ""species x"" to Bolterpeton. Nevertheless they say that these specimens are ""closely related"" to Bolterpeton, but ""because of the size difference between Bolterpeton and Species X, it cannot be said whether Species X is a different species or an ontogenetic variant.""

The bed from which the fossils come is a deep red shale, exposed on a series of hills over an area about an eighth of a mile on each side. This bed is capped in many places by a thin, dense siltstone. Overlying the siltstone is an orange-red shale that carries gypsum biscuits. Underlying the producing layer, which averages about four feet in thickness, is a brownish-red shale that is devoid\r\nof fossils. The most distinctive feature of the bone-bearing shale, outside of the fact that it has fossils, is the occurrence of two types of vertically oriented ovoid structures. One type consists of mottled red and green, hard nodules that range from one to four inches in maximum diameter and up to eighteen inches in length. They are rich in vertebrate remains. They appear to have formed around the bones after deposition, presumably as a result of the reducing action of organic materials. Their vertical orientation is somewhat\r\npuzzling. The contained vertebrate remains are usually oriented with their long axes vertical, and it seems quite certain that this position was attained after the formation of the nodules. Specimens of vertebrates free in the shale rather than in nodules are orientated with their long axes horizontal and have been subjected to considerable distortion and breakage. The most reasonable suggestion seems to be that the vertical orientation of the nodules was developed during compaction of the shales, which has been extensive, with the long axes shifting to become normal to the compacting forces.\r\nThe other vertical structures [...] have been termed pipes and have given the name to the site. They pass from the base to the top of the fossiliferous bed and, at the top, are continuous with the siltstone layer that caps the bed. Their composition is similar to the capping siltstone. The pipes are oval in cross section with maximum diameters from about four to twelve inches. Orientation of the long diameters is random, even in the 'clumps' in which the pipes tend to occur. These structures do not contain vertebrates, although specimens are found 'plastered' to their sides and occasionally penetrating the pipe for a short distance.\r\nThe origin of the pipes is by no means certain. It is thought that they were formed in open holes by the introduction of the sediment that formed the siltstone layer. Superficially, they resemble lungfish burrows of the Arroyo and Vale (Romer and Olson, 1954), but the shape, size, composition, weathering, and fossil content differ.

This specimen number, however, does not appear among the specimens of Phlegethontia cf. longissima listed by McGinnis (1967 p. 2) but one of these specimens bears the catalogue number UCMP 62580. The latter is listed as referred specimen of S. permianum in Lund (1978 p. 66). Anderson (2002, J. Paleont. 76(6) p. 1031) lists both UCMP 62480 and 62580 as type of S. permianum. Since UCMP 62480 is a braincase according to Lund (1978) and UCMP 62580 is a braincase as well (McGinnis, 1967; Lund, 1978) and since there is only one aistopod braincase present in the Fort Sill material (Anderson, 2002) the type of S. permianum is very likely to be UCMP 62580.\r\nAnderson & Reisz (2003) do not explicitly say when the type of Bolterpeton carrolli was collected but it is improbable that this specimen was known to Bolt in 1980. OMNH 71111 and OMNH 71112, although not explicitly mentioned by Bolt (1980), well may belong to the material that was originally assigned to ""species x"". Furthermore, Anderson & Reisz (2003) do not explicitly assign the remainder of ""species x"" to Bolterpeton. Nevertheless they say that these specimens are ""closely related"" to Bolterpeton, but ""because of the size difference between Bolterpeton and Species X, it cannot be said whether Species X is a different species or an ontogenetic variant.""

This specimen number, however, does not appear among the specimens of Phlegethontia cf. longissima listed by McGinnis (1967 p. 2) but one of these specimens bears the catalogue number UCMP 62580. The latter is listed as referred specimen of S. permianum in Lund (1978 p. 66). Anderson (2002, J. Paleont. 76(6) p. 1031) lists both UCMP 62480 and 62580 as type of S. permianum. Since UCMP 62480 is a braincase according to Lund (1978) and UCMP 62580 is a braincase as well (McGinnis, 1967; Lund, 1978) and since there is only one aistopod braincase present in the Fort Sill material (Anderson, 2002) the type of S. permianum is very likely to be UCMP 62580.\r\nAnderson & Reisz (2003) do not explicitly say when the type of Bolterpeton carrolli was collected but it is improbable that this specimen was known to Bolt in 1980. OMNH 71111 and OMNH 71112, although not explicitly mentioned by Bolt (1980), well may belong to the material that was originally assigned to ""species x"". Furthermore, Anderson & Reisz (2003) do not explicitly assign the remainder of ""species x"" to Bolterpeton. Nevertheless they say that these specimens are ""closely related"" to Bolterpeton, but ""because of the size difference between Bolterpeton and Species X, it cannot be said whether Species X is a different species or an ontogenetic variant.""

This specimen number, however, does not appear among the specimens of Phlegethontia cf. longissima listed by McGinnis (1967 p. 2) but one of these specimens bears the catalogue number UCMP 62580. The latter is listed as referred specimen of S. permianum in Lund (1978 p. 66). Anderson (2002, J. Paleont. 76(6) p. 1031) lists both UCMP 62480 and 62580 as type of S. permianum. Since UCMP 62480 is a braincase according to Lund (1978) and UCMP 62580 is a braincase as well (McGinnis, 1967; Lund, 1978) and since there is only one aistopod braincase present in the Fort Sill material (Anderson, 2002) the type of S. permianum is very likely to be UCMP 62580.\r\nAnderson & Reisz (2003) do not explicitly say when the type of Bolterpeton carrolli was collected but it is improbable that this specimen was known to Bolt in 1980. OMNH 71111 and OMNH 71112, although not explicitly mentioned by Bolt (1980), well may belong to the material that was originally assigned to ""species x"". Furthermore, Anderson & Reisz (2003) do not explicitly assign the remainder of ""species x"" to Bolterpeton. Nevertheless they say that these specimens are ""closely related"" to Bolterpeton, but ""because of the size difference between Bolterpeton and Species X, it cannot be said whether Species X is a different species or an ontogenetic variant.""

Since UCMP 62480 is a braincase according to Lund (1978) and UCMP 62580 is a braincase as well (McGinnis, 1967; Lund, 1978) and since there is only one aistopod braincase present in the Fort Sill material (Anderson, 2002) the type of S. permianum is very likely to be UCMP 62580.\r\nAnderson & Reisz (2003) do not explicitly say when the type of Bolterpeton carrolli was collected but it is improbable that this specimen was known to Bolt in 1980.

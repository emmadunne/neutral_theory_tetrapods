# Neutral Simulations of Early Tetrapod Diversity

This repository accompanies Dunne et al. (2023) Mechanistic neutral models show that sampling biases drive the apparent explosion of early tetrapod diversity. *Nature Ecology and Evolution*


Code for running simulations using `pycoalescence` to understand patterns of early tetrapod diversity using ecological neutral theoryma can be found here: [github.com/thompsonsed/palaeo_neutral_sims](https://github.com/thompsonsed/palaeo_neutral_sims)
